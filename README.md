# HamstersAI Core Logic


# HAMSAI

Welcome to the core logic of HamstersAI/$HAMSAI, designed to ensure a level of verifiably fair gameplay. Our current simulation uses a sophisticated randomization algorithm to dictate the pace and outcome of each race, ensuring that every hamster's chance of winning is as equal and fair as possible.

## Current Implementation

The race logic now incorporates the Fisher-Yates (Knuth) shuffle algorithm to randomize the order in which hamsters move each turn. This improvement ensures that the randomness is uniform, making the race outcomes more unpredictable and fair. This method replaces previous less reliable randomization techniques, marking a significant step towards our goal of verifiable fairness in gameplay.

## Future Directions

Looking ahead, we aim to introduce AI agents to represent each Hamster. This development will allow individual hamsters to employ unique tactics and strategies, diversifying the outcomes of races beyond the current model, which relies solely on chance. With AI agents, racing dynamics will evolve based on winnings and individual performance, moving away from the static racing lines of today.

This AI-driven approach is not limited to racing; it can be adapted to a variety of mini-games within the HamstersAI ecosystem. By integrating AI, we envision a future where gameplay is not only fair but also richly varied and engaging, offering a unique experience with every interaction.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve the HamstersAI experience.
